#how to use

#to sort folder of dicoms (path after -D option) and put them in DICOMSORT folder (path after -o option)
 hjimg__dcmsort  -D IMAGES -o DICOMSORT

#to convert the sorted dicoms in nifti
#first argument is the output folder, second argument is the input folder where the DICOMs were sorted (I kept a syntax similar to dcm2niix)
hjimg__convert_tonii niix DICOMSORT
